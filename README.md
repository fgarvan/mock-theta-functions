    There are three directories:
 (1) maple-programs
 (2) maple-worksheets
 (3) papers

 (1) maple programs
     This directory contains various programs for computing the 
     coefficients of some of Ramanujan's mock-theta functions.
     The programs depend on recurrences related to identities.
     Some identities for the 3rd functions can be found in Watson's 
     paper "The Final Problem". See in the papers directory.
